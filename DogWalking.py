#Pyhton3 object oriented programming example
#Covers the following:
#Initialization attributes of a class. 
#Instantiating bojects from a class, instantiating is a fancy term for creating a new, unique instance of a class.
#Inheritence of properties from parent class.
#Extending/overriding the properties of parent class.
#Accessing/modifying the properties of the object.
